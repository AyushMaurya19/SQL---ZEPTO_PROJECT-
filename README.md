üìà Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The project measures and analyzes the following KPIs using SQL:
1. Top Discounts: <br>
.Identify products with the highest discount percentages to find best-value deals. 
2. High-Value Out-of-Stock Products:<br>
Spot expensive items that are out of stock to highlight lost revenue opportunities.
3. Estimated Revenue:<br>
Calculate the total potential revenue for each product category based on current stock and selling price. 
4. High MRP, Low Discount Products:<br>
Find premium-priced items with minimal discounts for margin analysis. (Q4)
5. Average Discount by Category:<br>
Determine which categories offer the highest average discounts to inform promotional strategies. 
6. Price per Gram:<br>
Compute the cost efficiency of products based on price per unit weight. 
7. Weight-Based Segmentation:<br>
Group products into weight categories: Low, Medium, and Bulk, for better inventory planning. 
8. Total Inventory Weight:<br>
Analyze the total weight of available stock per category to assess logistics and storage needs.
